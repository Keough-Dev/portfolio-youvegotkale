<p>Programmer from Jersey but now call Center City Philadelphia my home. I have 
my masters in data science from Stockton University, while 
also working with software development and web design/development. 
I've been utilizing this strange time we find ourselves 
living in to expand my toolbox and learn all I can about different 
languages, technologies, methodologies and more. 
At the end of the day I'm just a kid that loves learning new 
things and is willing to take any new challenge, requirement, or 
metaphorical knuckleball that a potential job role might throw my way. 
On a more personal note I'm a huge Minnesota sports fan so Philly
isn't always exactly the City of Brotherly Love for me in that regard. I also 
personal train as a NASM certified personal trainer and certified sports
performance specialist, along with being an AFAA certified group fitness
instructor. Free training sessions might just come along as a package deal 
with any potential job offers.

As far as the website itself goes, it is essentially just functioning as a 
digital/interactive resume in its formative stages here. In the future I plan
on continuing to build upon the projects section (am just about finished 
with some pretty cool NLP text generation content using LSTM recurrent
networks with TV scripts and song lyrics). On top of this I am looking into 
adding a more traditional blog section as well as a gallery of website landing 
pages and other web development content. Stay tuned for all of this, I hope 
you already enjoy the site in its early stages here, and feel free to contact
me with any questions or comments through email, Github, or Linkedin which are 
all linked below.
<br>
The last small piece of house cleaning here is that this site is currently
being built using Jekyll and 100% hand coded html and css. From here it is 
being hosted through Github Pages, judging on the future growth and compute 
requirements of the site the next step would be to refactor it to run on Ruby 
on Rails or Node.js.
