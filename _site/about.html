    <h1>Kyle Keough</h1>
    <h3>I do Data Science, Statistics, Software Development, Web Design, and Personal Train on the side</h3>
</div>
</div>

<p>Programmer from New Jersey in pursuit of my official Jack of all Trades 
certificate. After moving to Philly I find myself as a Minnesota sports 
fan trying to survive in the heart of Eagles country. First and foremost
my experience comes as a data scientist after completing my masters in 
data science and strategic analytics at Stockton University. Along the 
way I've done all I can to expand the tool box and learn as much as I can 
in a wide range of domains. Through this I've gained experience and 
knowledge with software development, web development and design, dev ops
and more. At the end of the day I'm just a kid that loves learning new 
things and is willing to take any new language, technology, challenge, 
or metaphorical curveball in stride. On a non-software note, 
I supplement my life of countless hours sitting at my laptop by staying 
active as a triple certified personal trainer with a concentration in 
sports performance. Helping to keep the office in shape can come free
of charge as an added bonus to any coding contributions.
