        Any Philadelphia resident has undoubtedly passed the racks of
        blue bikes on the sides of various streets. These bike racks are 
        operated by Philadelphia 
        based ride sharing company, Indego, which actually has all of its ride 
        data publicly available for download. Due to this ride info being 
        readily available and how ubiquitous Indego is in Philadelphia, I 
        decided to analyze trends in their rides, how they are impacted by 
        weather and more. The data is very comprehensive 
        spanning back to 2015, along with being mostly clean right out of the 
        box. The numbers end up painting an informative picture of 
        the company's dealings, so on that note, let's get to the numbers.

        As alluded to earlier, the ultimate goal here was to examine the 
        relationship between weather and the number of daily rides. 
        Before we can jump into this question, however, we need to start 
        with some exploratory data analysis. 

        <p>

            Below is the total number of rides by year, and what jumped out at me 
            first was how much of an outlier 2016 was in 
            terms of total rentals. There were no major differences in average 
            weather for the year that could be pointed to as the cause. Whether 
            this discrepancy was due to Indego being "the new cool thing" or it 
            was due to something operational that could be duplicated, it's 
            certainly worth further investigation by the company's decision makers.
            
        </p>

    <p>
        Now we come to rides by month of the year, and even before taking 
        weather data into account a clear seasonal correlation can be seen. 
        This pattern alone could help predict daily rentals within a reasonable 
        margin. Adjusting the number of bikes in circulation or the number of 
        operational stations could be a good way to cut costs and take advantage
        of the lower volume in down seasons.

        Next, if you simply look at the total distribution of rides by day you'll see 
        that there is very little deviation amongst them, but this doesn't 
        tell the whole story.

        Breaking down the daily ride distribution by pass type reveals a more 
        interesting relationship. Daily passes have a much higher rental volume 
        on weekends while subscription passes have a much greater amount of 
        rides on weekdays.

        Below we have the total daily ride counts by day of the week for daily
        passes.

        <p>    

        This makes logical sense considering people may use 
        subscription services as their main form of transportation while daily 
        passes may be used more for leisure on days off. This could potentially 
        be capitalized on with promotions for daily passes on week days to 
        hopefully draw in more customers on slower days or by utilizing other 
        discount offers.

            Initial weather EDA shows the only two weather conditions with an
            apparent correlation are temperature and chance of precipitation.
            For example, all days exceeding a total ride count of 5000 were 
            when the temperature was warmer than 60 degrees. And the trend for 
            precipitation chance is that the data is very variable when there is 
            a 0% chance of rain since it is then not a factor, but then generally
            begins to decrease as the chances rise. These two graphics can be 
            seen below.

            Regression Analysis

        <p>

        For the remainder of the analysis and the later regression models I will 
        be omitting 2015 and 2016 in order to accurately portray recent trends 
        and exclude clear outliers. This could be handled in other ways such as 
        weighted regression with a heavier emphasis on recent years, but due to 
        the sheer size of the difference and for the sake of simplicity, the 
        omission approach will be taken.
        
        After experimenting with different available data it turned out that 
        the most accurate regression model was a simple one containing only 
        mean temperature, precipitation chance, and a binary variable for 
        holiday or not. Using this equation an r^2 value of roughly 0.7 was 
        achieved with a root mean square error of only 569 for the years 
        between 2017 and early 2020. While a lot of this is seasonally 
        driven and could be seen from the earlier EDA, being able to predict 
        daily ride counts within a reasonable margin like this can be highly 
        useful for forecasting and resource allocation. 

        Below the first scatter plot is the actual ride data between 2017-2019, 
        and the second scatter plot is the predicted ride counts for these days.
