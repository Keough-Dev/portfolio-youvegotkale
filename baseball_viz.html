        Overview

    <p>
        So as a final project for my data visualization course during my time 
        in my masters program, the final task of the course was to create a 
        webpage with Plotly Dash to display some form of a graphic. The framing
        of the assignment was intended to be broad, and how I ran with it was 
        making an interactive data visualization database if you will rather 
        than produce one visualization and format it on a site. By this I mean 
        that I took a comprehensive assortment of historical baseball data by 
        individual player, team, and league and allowed the user to dynamically 
        view whatever stats or scope they were interested. Iâ€™ll go into a more 
        in depth description of this, give a demo, discuss how the structure of 
        the code could have been improved (essentially a roast of past Kyle), 
        and more in the video below so I hope you enjoy.
        The full code can be found here:
