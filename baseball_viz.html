        Overview

    <p>
        As a final project for my data visualization course during my time 
        in my masters program, the task was to create a 
        webpage with Plotly Dash to display some form of a graphic. The framing
        of the assignment was intended to be broad, and how I ran with it was 
        making an interactive data visualization tool rather 
        than produce one visualization and format it on a site. By this I mean 
        that I took a comprehensive assortment of historical baseball data by 
        individual player, team, and league and allowed the user to dynamically 
        view whatever stats or scope they were interested. A quick demonstration
        of what the site looks like and how it operates is linked below, but I'll
        give a quick run down. So the site operates on a tab hierarchy, so for 
        any of the top 3 tabs your page is currently on (player, team, or league),
        any of the lower 3 tabs (batting stats, pitching stats, or fielding
        stats) can be visualized. Legends find themselves on the bottom of each 
        page explaining what any asterisks or numbers next to titles represent.
        The graphs also have color coordination based on if the selected player
        had won any awards in that given season. 
        <br>
        Some hiccups I ran into with this project were first of all the huge
        amount of players that have played the game since the 1900 threshold I 
        set for the year. This caused some latency issues which you will 
        notice in the video below when I switch between statistic categories 
        (from batting to pitching) for individual players. Ultimately this 
        did not to prove to be a major issue, and this issue did not affect 
        any of the site's latency outside of individual players, but it is 
        something I could address if this site was to move to more of a 
        production setting. I could add another dropdown to break up the 
        players alphabetically (i.e. A-D, E-G, etc. for last names) if I was
        to stick with Dash. However, given production standards I would move 
        this project to a different framework where I could cache and 
        store the data differently. In hindsight the code could have been more 
        modular, this partly being due to limitations in Dash's syntax and 
        partly due to naivety on my part at the time I had coded it, so this 
        could also be addressed if I were to go back and refactor this project.
