        Overview
    </div>
    <p>As great as the read_csv() method in the Pandas library is, 
        without further intervention it will often type cast columns 
        inefficiently in terms of space complexity. In order to tackle 
        this problem in a repeatable way rather than address the size of 
        the memory footprint, I took the liberty of writing a quick module 
        that could be imported and handle this issue automatically.

        The full code will be attached below, but the general idea of the 
        function is to loop through the columns of a given dataframe and 
        asses the values of each to see if they can be stored as a more 
        efficient type. While the function has a large number of if statements, 
        the only nesting is the if statements inside of the lone for loop, so 
        with the exception of very large dataframes the time complexity should 
        scale relatively well. If time complexity is more important than space 
        complexity for a given project, then this function may not provide the 
        best trade off, but for space complexity sensitive projects this could 
        provide a useful tool. The general actions the function takes is 
        reducing the number of bits associated with ints based on the maximum 
        value of a column and converting objects or strings to category 
        variables based on the number of unique values. The available parameters
        are what threshold should be used to convert a variable to a category 
        variable, the verbosity level of the function (how much data you would 
        like to be printed about the change in memory footprint) and whether or
        not the final frame should be stored in a pickle or zip file. The full
        documentation of the function can be seen below, as well as a small 
        example / proof of concept of the function in use.

        <p>Here is just a quick vim file importing the module, adding 
           print statements to show our starting and ending memory 
           footprints, setting verbosity to 1 so we will see the percent
           decrease in our memory footprint on output, and saving the 
           new dataframe to both a pickle and zip file.

        <p>Below you will see the output from running the test script from
            above using the module, as well as the files being created in 
            the same directory as the scripts.
